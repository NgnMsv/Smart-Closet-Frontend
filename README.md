# Smart-Closet-Frontend
This project is the frontend for a smart closet management application, built using React. It allows users to upload images of their clothing, categorize them, and view personalized outfit recommendations generated by a machine learning-based recommendation system. The recommendation system, powered by a Decision Tree algorithm (implemented in the backend), predicts the likelihood that a user will like a specific outfit combination based on their previous feedback.
